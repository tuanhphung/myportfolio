# My Portfolio

This portfolio was created from the start as a way to apply what I have learnt from React on to my personal website.

# Libraries Used

## Framer-Motion

Library used for animation of components and elements for smooth transitioning in to view.

## React-Intersection-Observer

Used to detect when a component is within view of the users window, to allow for components render in to view.
